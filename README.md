# Named-Entity-Recognition-BERT-test


## Purpose 

This is a simple repo about some test made on Name Entity Recognition task. The goal is to extract entities using a BERT model where, each entity, can ben a single or a group of words referring to the same category.


## Techniques used:
Here it is a brief summary about the techniques used in this project:

- **BERT**: a transformers-based model, SOTA for NLP related tasks;
- **Inside-Outside-Beginning** (IOB) tagging during the text preprocessing;
- **PyTorch** for customizing the final model and train BERT on the NER task


Other information can be found in the code

## Dependencies:
- ```torch```;
- ```numpy```, ```pandas```, ```tqdm```;
- ```matplotlib```;
- ```transformers``` for the tokenizer.
